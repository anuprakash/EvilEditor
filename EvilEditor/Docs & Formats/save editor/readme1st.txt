   General
*-----------*

Usage should be simple, open up a .lay file located in your Evil Genius folder, 
under DynamicResources\Layouts. The loading will take some time, during which the
program will not respond to input. After loading is done just change what you want.

NOTE: NOT EVERY VALUE IS TESTED. IF YOU CHANGE THE VALUES TOO MUCH, THE GAME WILL CRASH AFTER LOADING

During saving, the program will not respond to input either.



For people intrested, there's a work-in-progress (will probably be WIP forever) save game format documentation file.
